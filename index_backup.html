    <p style="color:red;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightblue;margin-top: 100px;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;"> TIME MACHINE CAN TAKE US TO FUTURE , PAST AND PRESENT IF WE ARE IN FUTURE OR PAST
      WE CAN MAKE THE PRESENT MORE BETTER AND AWESOME. </p>
      <p style="color:green;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightwhite;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;">The Time Machine is a science fiction novella by H. G. Wells, published in 1895 and written as a frame narrative.</p> 
      <p style="color:blue;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightblack;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;"> The work is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel by using a vehicle or device to travel purposely and </p>
      <p style="color:yellow;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightblue;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;">selectively forward or backward through time. The term "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle or device.[1]
       The Time Machine has been adapted into three feature films of the same name, as well as two television versions and many comic book adaptations.</p>
    <p style="color:grey;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightwhite;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;">It has also indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media productions. </p> 
     <p style="color:darkgrey;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightblue;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;">The book's protagonist is a Victorian English 
       scientist and gentleman inventor living in Richmond, Surrey, identified by a narrator simply as the Time Traveller. </p>
     <p style="color:lightgrey;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightwhite;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;">Similarly, with but one exception (a man named 
       Filby) none of the dinner guests present are ever identified by name, but rather by profession (for example, "the Psychologist") or physical description 
       (for example, "the Very Young Man").</p>

    <p style="color:lightgreen;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightwhite;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;">The narrator recounts the Traveller's lecture to
      his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth dimension and demonstrates a tabletop model machine for travelling through the fourth dimension. </p>
     <p style="color:voilet;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightgreen;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;">He reveals that he has built a machine capable 
       of carrying a person through time, and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator. </p>

 <p style="color:grey;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightwhite;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;">  In the new narrative, the Time Traveller tests his device.</p> <p style="color:grey;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightblue;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;">
    At first he thinks nothing has happened but soon finds out he went five hours into the future.</p>
    <p style="color:darkred;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightblue;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;">
      He continues forward and sees his house disappear and turn into a lush garden.</p> <p style="color:grey;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightgreen;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 
        100px;"> The Time Traveller stops in A.D. 802,701, where he meets the Eloi, a society 
   of small, elegant, childlike adults.</p>  <p style="color:lightpink;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightwhite;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;">They live
    in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings, and adhere to a fruit-based
   diet. His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline.</p> <p style="color:grey;border: 1px solid black;background-color: 
     lightblue;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;">
    They appear happy and carefree but fear the dark,
   and particularly moonless nights.</p> <p style="color:grey;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightgreen;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;">
    Observing them, he finds that they give no response to mysterious nocturnal disappearances, possibly because the thought 
   of it alone frightens them into silence. </p> <p style="color:grey;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightwhite;margin-right: 150px;margin-left: 100px;">
    He speculates that they are a peaceful society.</p> <p style="color:grey;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightblue;margin-right: 150px;margin-left:
      100px;">    After exploring the area around the Eloi's residences, 
   the Time Traveller reaches the top of a hill overlooking London.</p> <p style="color:grey;border: 1px solid black;background-color: lightgreen;margin-right: 
     150px;margin-left: 100px;">
    He concludes that the entire planet has become a garden, 
   with little trace of human society or engineering from the hundreds of thousands of years prior. </p>
